    "## Introduction\n",
    "The selected dataset (Ford GoBike System dataset from 2019) is a dataset that contains information on bike rentals from the Ford GoBike bike sharing system. The dataset includes information such as the start and end station, start and end time, duration of the ride, and user information (e.g., whether the user is a subscriber or a customer, and their birth year). It also contains geospatial information such as the latitude and longitude of the start and end station. It likely covers multiple months, the duration is likely covering a full year or a portion of it in 2019. The dataset may be used to analyze bike rental patterns and user behavior, as well as help city planners and bike sharing companies improve the bike sharing system.\n"

    "> I looked at my variable of interest from two perspectives: how is usage distributed per day and per hour? First of all, I decided to only use the *start_time* variable to answer this question, because outliers caused by programmatic bugs seemed less likely for checkins than checkouts. Most trips are taking place during the week and the least are taken during the weekend. There is some variety between the days of the week itself, but the seperation between weekdays and weekend is especially salient. This suggests that the target audience might be either students or (young) professionals. After diving deeper into the data by visualizing the distribution per hour, there are clear peaks around 8:00 and 17:00. In other words, people leaving home to go to work and people going home from their work.\n",

    "### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The fact that Thursday is more popular than other days of the week is noticable, and would require further research and additional data. Distribution by hour and user type further confirmed the initial hypothesis that young professionals are the target audience of this system. Changing the datatype of the *start_time* and *end_tim*e columns was necessary to extract information from this column. I decided to remove all observations which reported a birth year before 1920: the likeliness of someone over 100 being physically capable of cycling, although not impossible, is low. I researched the necesssity of fractional digits in long- and latitude data, those turned out to be necessary, so I decided to leave those alone. Other than that, there was no data I thought required transformation, at least not for the purpose of this analysis."

A heatmap of the correlation between age (bins of 20 years, the generally accepted range of a generation) and day of the week shows exactly how skewed the data is: in the 1980-2000 group there are between 11.000 and 25.000 trips on a specific day, whereas the first (1920-'40) and the last (2000-'20) are barely over 100 and less than 50 over the course of the entire week, respectively.\n",

    "> When generating a scatterplot the duration data seems simultaneously platykurtic and leptokurtic: highly centered around a mean, but with a wide range. To determine the IQR, I visualized a boxplot and emperically determined the range. The first conclusion that can be draw from this boxplot is that approximately 75% of all trips taken during the week take between 300 and 750 seconds: between 5 en 12.5 minutes and that trips on average last 500 seconds, or 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Additionally, the wider IQR for Saturday and Sunday suggests that there are less very long trips (outliers). Finally, the ten most popular start and end stations. By creating a stacked bar chart, I hoped to quickly figure whether there is a correlation between start and end stations: as it turns out, yes, 9/10 of the most popular stations are shared.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "> In conclusion, my analysis of the GoBike usage data revealed a strong correlation between age and usage, with young professionals being the primary target audience. Furthermore, I observed that the day of the week and hour of the day variables had a significant impact on usage patterns. Additionally, I found that while there is a high degree of similarity between the start and end stations, there is not a perfect correlation between the two. The variance in trip duration was also found to be high, although the interquartile range was relatively small. Based on these findings, I recommend that Ford, as the operator of the GoBike service, consider partnering with businesses and offering a package tailored towards young professionals in order to expand their GoBike business. The above findings are based on the data available and further research may be needed to validate my findings.\n"
